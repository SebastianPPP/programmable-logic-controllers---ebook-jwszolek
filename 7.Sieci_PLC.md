# Driver networks 

## Standard serial links 

### RS-232 (EIA-232) 

One of the first standards was the RS-232 (RS means Recommended Standard) introduced by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) in 1962, then revised in 1969 and finally designated RS-232C. It is still a technology commonly used for communication in PLCs. 

Data transmission takes place over an asymmetrical (single-end) link bit by bit at a distance of approximately 15 meters at a speed up to 20 Kb/s. 

The transmitter is a voltage source not exceeding 25V, which should be resistant to short circuit to ground. The short-circuit current must not be more than 0,5A. 

On data lines voltage levels between -15V to -3V with respect to the „Common Ground” (GND) pin means logic „1”. Similarly, for the voltages between +3V to +15V we have a logical zero. The reverse logic applies to control lines. 

The range beween -3V and +3V is not a valid RS-232 level. The signal in this range must not last more than 1ms, and moreover, the time passed through this area cannot be longer than 3% of the bit duration. 

### RS-422 (EIA-422) 

Technical standard originated by EIA, first issued in 1975, that specified electrical characteristics of a digital signaling circuit. The transmission circuits are symmetrical and balanced.  

The reason for this is the use of a differential transmitter, a two-wire balanced transmission path and a receiver with a differential input. RS-422 systems can transmit data at rates as high as 10 Mb/s, or may be sent on cables as long as 1,200 meters at lower rates. The transmission speed results from the limitation imposed in this standard on the rate of signal changes and bit duration. 

The transmitter has a differentia output circuit with a balanced voltage from 2V to 6V and a resistance of up to 100 ohms. The short-circuit current of this source does not exceed 0,15A. 

The receiver must have an input impedance of at least 4 kiloohms. The input threshold voltage is 200mV for voltages of -7V to 7V. It is specified that is must not be damaged when the power is switched off or switched on under conditions when a short circuit occurs on the line or to the ground. 

### RS-485 (EIA-485) 

Standard originally introduced in 1983. Electrical signaling is balanced and multipoint systems are supported. They can include multiple transmitters and receivers. Line matching is provided by two transistors Rt = 60 ohms placed at the beginning and the end. 

It is generally accepted that RS-485 can be used with data rates up to 10 Mb/s or, at lower speeds, distances up to 1,200 m. As a rule of thumb, the speed in bit/s multiplied by the length in metres should not exceed 108. Thus a 50-meter cable should not signal faster than 2 Mb/s. 

The transmitter has a differential output circuit with balanced voltage of -1,5V to 5V and a resistance of not more than 60 ohms. The short-circuit current does not exceed 0,15A at short to ground. In contrast to RS-422 (which has a driver circuit that cannot be switched off), RS-485 drivers use three-state logic allowing individual transmitters to be deactivated. Only one can transmit at a time, and the others should be in a high impedance state. However, they must have collision protection while transmitting several transmitters at the same time. 

The transmitter can be loaded by a maximum of 32 receivers and 2 matching resistances Rt. The load can be a circuit with a consumption of 1mA at a common voltage of 12V, but there can be no additional resistors. 

The receiver must have an input impedance of not less than 12 kilohms. Its electrical parameters determine the threshold input voltage, which is 200mV for common voltages from -7V to 12V and the voltage-current characteristics of the input circuit.

## Types of data transmission 

Data transmission in the links described above is divided into asynchronous and synchronous transmission. 

Asynchronous transmission involves transmitting individual characters using single lines of data. A line at rest represents a logical one. The first character is a start bit with a value of 0, and the next bits are an ASCII character starting with LSB. At the end there are 1 or 2 bits of stop with a value of 1. The transmission of bits within the character is synchronized with the timing of the transmitter, and the characters are transmitted asynchronously.

*Example of asynchronous transmission*

In synchronous transmission, thanks to a specific clocking pulse (signal), a constant rate of information transfer is maintained. There are no interruptions caused by the need to synchronize individual portions of information, so we get better use of connecting lines. The data is sent as a data frame with start and end markers that allow synchronization on the receiving side. Reception requires bit recognition (bit synchronization) and combining bits into characters (character synchronization).

*Example of synchronous transmission*

These are phisical layer tasks. At the data linking layer, the task of communication is to establish and abandon communication links, transfer data, and detect errors. This is done using communication protocols such as: 
- MODBUS
- PROFIBUS
- M-Bus
- S-Bus
- BACnet 

## Network topologies 

A computer network topology is a model of the connection arrangement of various elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network. The term network topology can refer to the physical or logical construction of the network. 

In the case of such connections, a local area network (LAN) is created, which can have a diverse network structure (topology).

*Hierarchical topology*

*Mesh topology* 

The most common are star, loop and ring topologies. 

In a star structure, the central point is the hub, which has a separate link to each network element. Even the usual RS 232 interface can be used in such a network. 

A looped network has a network controller that controls and tests the attached network elements. Each item sends data to the next by adding its share of the data. The disadvantage of this structure is the failure of the entire system when there is a failure of one element or connection. 

In a ring network, all elements are legitimate, and a network controller is redundant. The data is transmitted in one direction. Collisions are prevented by a control token sent by the station that processed the data last. Another option to prevent collisions is a rule that provides time division for the progress of individual network elements. 

In serial or bus networks, the earliest rule was used to exchange data packets in the network using the master-slave method, which authorizes only the element of the network with the master-title to initiate transmission. Such a network also uses broadcast transmissions, in which messages are sent simultaneously to all subscribers. 

In a bus network, data can also be exchanged by delegating access to the network. It consists in the fact that we assign a token to subsequent elements of the network that provides access to the network and the ability to transfer our own data (global variables) to other participants of data exchange in this network. 

## Characteristics of selected networks 

### Modbus 

Modbus is a communication protocol developed by Modicon. It is used to communicate with programmable controllers of this company, as well as other manufacturers. It allows you to manage the network of devices such as the temperature and humidity control system. Versions for the serial port and for IP networks were created. IP networks use TCP on port 502.  

Modbus is a Client-Server protocol based on master-slave transaction. Modbus is now an open standard, which has contributed to the widespread standard. Initially, it operated through the RS-232 serial port, but with the development of the protocol, it was possible to use RS-485, which allowed to increase the transmission speed. 

Modbus has 247 child nodes and each of them has a designated response time. When this time is exceeded, the master starts handling the error procedure.

### Profibus 

Real-time industrial network standard. There can be up to 127 drivers in the network. The extent of the network depends on the transmission medium used. Profibus can operate at the transmission speeds from 9600 bit/s to 12000 kbit/s. ProfiBus is a deterministic network. Communication can be broadcast master/slave or master/master. 

The Profibus FMS standard uses the services of platform 2 and 7 of the ISO/OSI models. Layer 2 provides compatibility at the level of acknowledgment and unacknowledged broadcast telegrams. Level 7 provides the standard level. A driver for sharing standard series, strings, arrays, records by specifying their common. Other drivers may write or write these variables in legal devices. It is also possible to control tools on the control (steer, hold, restart, etc.). In addition, ProfibusDP. It is a transmission for very fast operation of decentralized I/O devices. The controller polls the local I/O drivers all the time. 

It is commonly used in Europe. Transmission is compatible with RS485. 

Profibus is a bus topology with master and slave nodes. It works with marker and has data link layer with or without the key.

## Other types of networks 

### Controller Area Network (CAN)  

It is a serial communication bus was created in the 1980s by Robert Bosch GmbH for applications in the automotive industry (ABS, engine control), although it is also used in other areas (construction)[1] . Currently, it is also used in industrial field buses (most popular standards: CANopen, DeviceNet, SDS). 
- Used in automotive technology and automation.
- Bus links.
- CSMA/CA link. 

### Sercos
- Used to control the movement of machine tool drives.
- Ring link with fiber optic line.
- Collision-free communication through the use of a time-slot mechanism.
- Highly efficient communication protocol (little overhead).
- Extremely low telegram jitter (specified at less than 1 microsecond, in practice as low as 35 nanoseconds).
- Highly developed standardized profiles agreed upon by multi-vendor technical working groups for dependable interoperability of devices from different manufacturers.
- Ability to control, for example, 60 axes of motion at an update of 250 microseconds for each and every drive (Sercos III). 

### Interbus 

INTERBUS is a serial bus system which transmits data between control systems and spatially distributed I/O modules that are connected to sensors and actuators. 

At the moment, more than 600 manufacturers are involved in the implementation of INTERBUS technology in control systems and field devices. 

Since 2011 is the INTERBUS technology hosted by the industry association Profibus and Profinet International. 

## Industrial networks 

The most popular industrial network is Ethernet.  

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/74e6FYU.png)

The current decade is undoubtedly an increase in the use of Ethernet networks in industry and the popularization of Ethernet as a standard connecting machines and production halls with the IT infrastructure of industrial enterprises. These types of networks are used today for communication between industrial computers, HMI, controllers, and even actuators and drives. 

Ethernet is characterized by:
- Scalability.
- Security.
- Relatively low infrastructure costs.
- Possibility of easy integration with traditional IT systems. 

At the same time, the industry has developed a number of standards that allow for real-time operation, which is necessary in controlling the operation of machines that require synchronization of axis operation and robot control. 

According to HMS, Ethernet accounted for 52% of the global market compared to 46% a year earlier. The most popular such network is currently EtherNet/IP (15% market share). PROFINET, EtherCAT, Modbus-TCP and Ethernet POWERLINK. The growth rate of industrial Ethernet applications is 22%. 

The above statistics do not mean that field nets are in retreat! Yes, there are changes and the use of specific network solutions is changing, but the popularity of fieldbus networks is constantly increasing, which is due to, among others, cyber security issues.
